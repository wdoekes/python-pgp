    :Parameters:
      key : byte string
        The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher.
        Its length may vary from 5 to 16 bytes.
    :Keywords:
      mode : a *MODE_** constant
        The chaining mode to use for encryption or decryption.
        Default is `MODE_ECB`.
      IV : byte string
        (*Only* `MODE_CBC`, `MODE_CFB`, `MODE_OFB`, `MODE_OPENPGP`).

        The initialization vector to use for encryption or decryption.

        It is ignored for `MODE_ECB` and `MODE_CTR`.

        For `MODE_OPENPGP`, IV must be `block_size` bytes long for
        encryption and `block_size` +2 bytes for decryption (in the
        latter case, it is actually the *encrypted* IV which was
        prefixed to the ciphertext). It is mandatory.

        For all other modes, it must be 8 bytes long.
      nonce : byte string
        (*Only* `MODE_EAX`).
        A mandatory value that must never be reused for any other
        encryption. There are no restrictions on its length, but it is
        recommended to use at least 16 bytes.
      counter : callable
        (*Only* `MODE_CTR`). A stateful function that returns the next
        *counter block*, which is a byte string of `block_size` bytes.
        For better performance, use `Crypto.Util.Counter`.
      mac_len : integer
        (*Only* `MODE_EAX`). Length of the MAC, in bytes.
        It must be no larger than 8 (which is the default).
      segment_size : integer
        (*Only* `MODE_CFB`).The number of bits the plaintext and
        ciphertext are segmented in.
        It must be a multiple of 8. If 0 or not specified, it will be
        assumed to be 8.
